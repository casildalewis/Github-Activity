There once was a tree in a forest in which there lived a family of owls. 
Tonight, the owls were asleep because it was midnight on Christmas eve. 
Suddenly, one of them heard a noise.

He knew he shoudn't go out to check on his own, after all he was the youngest owl and hadn't learned how to fly yet.
But he couldn't ignore his curiosity so he stepped out to take a look.
rising above was something he had never seen before.
