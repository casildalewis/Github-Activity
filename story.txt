There once was a tree in a forest in which there lived a family of owls. 
Tonight, the owls were asleep because it was midnight on Christmas eve. 
Suddenly, one of them heard a noise.

He knew he shoudn't go out to check on his own, after all he was the youngest owl and hadn't learned how to fly yet.
But he couldn't ignore his curiosity so he stepped out to take a look.
rising above was something he had never seen before.

Above the horizon rose a some form of large sled, led by 10 additional figures that the young owl couldn't quite make out.
He had seen planes before, but nothing like this new contraption, which certainly didn't sound like a plane.
He watched intently as the sled came to a halt on top of a small cottage in the distance, followed by a large man hopping out.
The owl couldn't believe his eyes, and considered going to investigate further, before eventually deciding against it. As he was
falling asleep, his mind was racing, trying to comprehend what he just saw.
